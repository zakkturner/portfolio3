# My new portfolio for 2021-2022 coming soon

My current is www.zach-turner.com

## What I used to build

### Next.Js/React

My portfolio is built with React 1. Because it is my most comfortable framework. 2. It works well with Animations and interactivity

I chose Next.js for SSR and to keep my app structured. This will help with mainly with SEO

### GSAP

I will always choose GSAP over CSS animations. Animations require logic and I like to use Javascript for my logic

### SCSS

SCSS is used for my styling. I use flexbox and grid for the layout of my site
